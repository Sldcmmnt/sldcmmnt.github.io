Knowledge session at ICTU
              </h2>
              <p>
ICTU, the innovation organization of and for the Dutch government, invited the Solid Community to a knowledge sharing session about Solid. <br>
We looked under the hood of the next generation of public services, focusing on important concepts such as data control, digital identity, wallets and proactive services.
The knowledge session was fully booked and in a well-filled room we discussed Solid and applications with interested ICTU employees. <br>
The demonstration of the Virtual Income Desk with Solid - to make it easier for residents to apply for benefits - in which ICTU is actively involved, was also discussed as a concrete example. 
It was an interesting session in which all kinds of interfaces, questions and developments were discussed, which require follow-up and in-depth discussion. <br>
Knowledge sharing sessions are part of our mission to embed Solid in society in a responsible manner based on public values.

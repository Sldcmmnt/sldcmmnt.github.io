Solid Community Foundation helps to build a human-centric society through responsible digisation, in the Netherlands as well as international contexts. <br>
We aspire to support health, finances, sustainability and overall better services.
Solid is a vision and a set of technical specifications to build a friendlier, safer, and more innovative web. The movement is started by founder of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners Lee and growing in Europe.

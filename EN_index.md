## What we do
Solid Community Foundation helps to build a human-centric society through responsible digisation, in the Netherlands as well as international contexts in Europe. <br>
Solid is a vision and a set of technical specifications to build a more friendly, safe, and innovative web. <br>
The movement is started by founder of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners Lee and growing in Europe.<br>
We use Solid to create a digital human-centric web which supports health, financial health, sustainability and overall better services.

## What we do
Solid Community Foundation helps to build a human-centric society through responsible digisation, in the Netherlands as well as international contexts in Europe. <br>
Solid is a vision and a set of technical specifications to build a friendlier, safer, and more innovative web. The movement is started by founder of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners Lee and growing in Europe.<br>
We use this vision to create a ecosystem that supports health, finances, sustainability and overall better services.
<br>
## Community
We embed this vision into society by a growing communnity of governemental and public organisations, researchers, organisations in health, energy and other domains.

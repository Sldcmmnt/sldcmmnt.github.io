## Foundation for a sustainable energy transition and supply
The energy sector is a vital part of both our society and our economy. 
From energy suppliers to consumers, and from network operators to policymakers - all rely on accurate and securely managed energy data. 
Solid enables users to safely store, manage, and reuse this important data in a smart and convenient way, with full control over who has access to their information.

## Collaboration in energy data
The intelligent and secure collaboration of energy data opens the door to in-depth insights into energy consumption and management. It supports managing energy consumption, linking different data sources, and generating insights. Data availability helps both individual consumers and businesses to work more efficiently, leading to more convenience, cost savings, and a reduction in the ecological footprint.

## The future of energy data and services
Consumers are increasingly using smart technologies such as energy meters, energy management systems, and supporting applications such as insightful questionnaires and energy comparators. These forms of support assist in monitoring and managing energy consumption, for example, the action perspective on insulation. However, often these data are stored in different systems. Solid offers an integrated solution, enabling a complete and holistic overview of energy consumption, leading to better energy management and greater awareness.

## In Action: Energy Projects
Currently, there are several projects in preparation in the energy sector around Solid. 
These collaborations will give consumers control over their energy data, contributing to more personalized services and efficient energy provision.

## What we do
Solid Community Foundation helps to build a human-centric society through responsible digitalization, in the Netherlands as well as international contexts in Europe. <br>
Solid is a vision and a set of technical specifications to build a more friendly, safe, and innovative web. <br>
The movement is started by founder of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners Lee and growing in Europe, and aligns with the European digital strategy of the European Commission.<br>
We use Solid to create a digital human-centric web which supports health, financial health, sustainability and overall better services.
<br>

## Community
We embed this vision into society by a growing communnity of governmental and public organisations, researchers, organisations in health, energy and other domains.

Although international projects are in preparation, since we are founded in the Netherlands our [Dutch website](https://www.solidcommunity.nl) is for now more extensive with information. <br>

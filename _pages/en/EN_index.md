title: Solid Community Foundation
description: Solid Community works on a friendlier, safer and more innovative web based on public values, in collaboration with governments, sectors and knowledge institutions. Working together as a community creates coherence and harmonization of developments, governance and architecture. We help to build a human-centric society through responsible digitalization, in the Netherlands as well as international contexts in Europe. The movement is started by founder of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners Lee and growing in Europe, and aligns with the European digital strategy of the European Commission.

What is Solid?
              </h2>
              <p>
Solid is an initiative of the founder of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners Lee, to make the web friendlier, more secure and more innovative.
Solid can provide added value in almost all sectors; from the energy sector, public sector, healthcare, media, retail to government. It supports safer and responsible data sharing and improvement of services and user-friendliness.

Collaborate
              </h2>
              <p>
The development of a friendlier web is a paradigm shift and does not happen automatically. The mission of the Solid Community is to organize that movement in a responsible manner from an independent and neutral approach and based on public values.
We connect a broad community with participants such as government, sectors, social partners and knowledge institutions and support them in:
<ul>
<li>Knowledge sessions for awareness</li>
<li>Development of test setups towards implementation</li>
<li>Generic trust framework and coherence</li>
</ul>  
In this way, the development of architecture, governance and adoption, is harmonized into a coherent whole.

Rent allowance, individual income allowance, housing allowance and other schemes are intended for vulnerable residents. <br>
But they do not always use the schemes to which they are entitled, because the procedures are too fragmented and complicated. 
The Virtual Income Desk uses data that is already known to complete and assess applications with a number of simple actions and to regularly check for any changes. 
This allows residents to apply for schemes more quickly and easily. 
This really puts the resident at the center rather than the schemes. And the government functions as a coherent, transparent and service-providing government.

## Practical example
The Virtual Income Desk is developing a simple, digital counter for all allowances schemes. The counter can be used by any resident or care provider. 
At that counter you can immediately see what allowances you are entitled to, and the compensation is granted immediately. 

## Project phase 1
The Solid Community Foundation has been asked to develop the first initial demonstration to simplify the application for benefits in combination with a data vault based on Solid's open technology.
Our partner in this project is ICTU: the innovation organization founded by the Dutch government and a partner of the Solid Community Foundation in safe and responsible data sharing.

## Purpose of this project
Many people do not use income schemes to which they are entitled. The application procedures are too complicated. And they have no confidence in the government. 
The Virtual Income Desk makes applying easier. This way, the citizen really takes center stage instead of the regulations. And the government functions as an open, transparent and coherent government.

## Description
The Virtual Income Desk is an open source project that is working on a solution whereby residents can apply for all schemes to which they are entitled with a simple push of a button. 
A large number of these applications can also be approved directly and automatically via the Virtual Income Desk.

This is done by making the rules for allowances openly available digitally and transparently. As soon as you log in with your data vault, your data can be checked. Forms are then no longer needed. 
You maintain control over your data in your data vault: you decide which data, with whom, for how long and for what purpose it may be used. 
Because the rule library is openly accessible, you can decide when you want to check it.
If you want, you can have the application that checks the rules for you check every week for changes. 
Because the counter can check the current data in your data vault as often as you want, you can be immediately informed if your situation changes and its influence on current arrangements. 
This process is separate from the application, and is therefore not visible to municipalities.

During your life and in care situations, often multiple healthcare providers are involved. People are the focus point in these care processes. 
                By placing the health data in a data vault, the relevant data can easily move along during the contacts that are needed. 
                In addition, the data vault may contain other sources of information that may be useful for understanding a person's context.

title: Collaborate
description: Using Solid can improve services and user experience and create opportunities for GDPR-compliant collaboration with chain partners. Solid can be applied in various sectors and domains such as healthcare, energy, municipalities, government implementation organizations, public organizations such as the cultural and library sectors, but also retail, media, etc. Do you work at an organization, umbrella organization or appointment system and is there a concrete Interested in working on projects around safe and responsible data sharing, possibly in collaboration with chain partners? A knowledge session or test setup with a serious look at implementation are examples of possibilities.

Knowledge session
              </h2>
              <p>
Many sectors and organizations are not yet aware of the global Solid movement and would first like to receive more information to explore how it can fit into their agenda and strategy.
A knowledge session is a good first step to learn more about the aspects of Solid.

Explore options for technical test setup and implementation

              <p>
The added value and effect often becomes tangible and more understandable once a test setup is developed. We develop test setups in several sectors together with technical experts, that are further scaled up to actual implementation. Want to more, please get in touch:

Trust framework, open architecture and coherence
              </h2>
              <p>
A scalable technical infrastructure does not work without a trust framework around data sharing, an open architecture and coherence with other developments such as sectoral agreement schemes, European wallets, national and European regulations. That is why we are building a generic system of trust, with an open architecture and coherence with other sectoral, national and international developments. In many sectors, permissions for users - humans - are a recurring theme. In order to promote the creation of a coherent, understandable digital landscape for people in all their roles (citizen, patient, consumer, student, etc.), we are developing this cohesively.
